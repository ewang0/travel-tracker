## Overview

Travel-Tracker is an application to manage and track different trips for users as well as a travel agency (administrator). App is populated with fictional travel data fetched from an API.

## Goals

``` Markdown
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
- Special consideration around accessibility and usability on devices. Lighthouse accessibility audit is at a 100%
- Exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication. The business-logic code driving functionality is cleanly separated from rendering, view-related code. Excellent usage of fetch and updates DOM based on results of network requests. Handles all scenarios for error handling.
```

## Technologies

  - Command-line interface
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Sass
  - Git
  - Fetch API
  - Mocha
  - Chai

## Demo

To see the project in action, clone the repo down to your local machine. You will need to clone down this [local server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) and have it running in a separate tab in your terminal each time you run the client. Once these two steps are completed, run:

```bash
npm start
```
